# About

Rockibot is a Discord bot created using [Discordjs/Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando/) and [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/Discord.js/). It is an extremely modular bot for those who want some features, and only one bot for it. And the modularity can easily be done via the dashboard at [the Rockibot Dashboard](https://dash.rockibot.ml). With the modularity, you can have moderation, suggestions, or both. More modules will be coming soon! You can also now visit the [Rockibot Website](https://rockibot.ml) for more information about the bot and it's commands!
